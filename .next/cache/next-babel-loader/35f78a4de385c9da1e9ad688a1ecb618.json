This takes away from their ability to focus\n          on their core job – education. Thus, the question for us was:\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Quote>\n          \"How might we help teachers reduce time spent on administrative work\n          so that they can focus on teaching?\"\n        </Quote>\n        <Subtitle>What administrative problem?</Subtitle>\n        <Paragraph>\n          To uncover the main issues teachers were facing, we conducted\n          interviews and mapped the various administrative matters they have to\n          deal with across the school year.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <FullImg2 />\n        <Paragraph3>\n          After a few session with various teachers, we found that{\" \"}\n          <b>sending announcements and collecting consent forms from parents</b>{\" \"}\n          was the most time-consuming activity (most frequent across the year +\n          difficulty).\n        </Paragraph3>\n        <Paragraph2>\n          Today, teachers distribute physical copies of a consent form or\n          announcement to students to pass to their parents. This leads to\n          issues including lost forms, forgotten forms and so on, causing\n          teachers to spend a lot of time chasing for them. Parents, too, face\n          similar issues like retrieving the form from their child's messy bag.\n        </Paragraph2>\n        <FullImg3 />\n        <Paragraph3>\n          Thus, we decided to tackle this problem space first.\n        </Paragraph3>\n        <Paragraph2>\n          Given that the teachers will be dealing with a large amount of\n          information, we choose to first develop a web app for schools. On the\n          other hand, with the frequent and unpredictable timing of school\n          announcements, a mobile app for parents made more sense.\n        </Paragraph2>\n        <Subtitle ref={this.Design}>Design</Subtitle>\n        <Paragraph>\n          I started by working closely with the product manager to understand\n          the deatiled feature prioritisation before mapping out rough flows.\n          Both mobile and web products were designed incrementally through\n          rounds of iterations and testings. View an early cut of the mobile app\n          flow <a href=\"https://overflow.io/s/E33Y22/\">here</a>\n        </Paragraph>\n        <FullImg4 />\n        <Paragraph3>\n          Along the way, there were some interesting design challenges we\n          encountered:\n        </Paragraph3>\n        <Subtitle>Consideration #1:</Subtitle>\n        <Quote2>How might we protect individuals with secret children?</Quote2>\n        <Paragraph>\n          While mapping out the user flow, we believed that directly displaying\n          the retrieved children's name based on the user's ID was a natural\n          thing to do. However, we soon had feedback that this was a problem for\n          individuals with children their spouses are unaware of. As the\n          government, it is not our intention to break families apart by\n          accidentally revealing family secrets.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph2>\n          Thus, we added a page to the flow to let the user know we will be\n          pulling this data and let them be in control of when this information\n          is shown. Users can then make the call to either proceed with\n          onboarding at a later date or move ahead.\n        </Paragraph2>\n        <FullImg5 />\n        <Subtitle>Consideration #2:</Subtitle>\n        <Quote2>\n          How might we help admins differentiate between the tasks they do as a\n          user and an admin?\n        </Quote2>\n        <Paragraph>\n          For schools in Singapore, the administrator of the system is often,\n          too, a teacher. This means that at any one time, an individual could\n          be juggling both their tasks as a teacher and as an admin. From\n          research we found that these users usually deal with these tasks\n          separately and view them as different responsibilities. Hence, we\n          decided to clearly separate the two.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph2>\n          This meant that the teacher would be able to first complete the tasks\n          they need to do as a teacher, then cleanly switch over to the admin\n          view to work on admin tasks, matching their mental model.\n        </Paragraph2>\n        <FullImg6 />\n        <Subtitle>Design Snapshot</Subtitle>\n        <FullImg7 />\n        <Subtitle ref={this.Result}>Results</Subtitle>\n        <Paragraph>\n          The product is now in use by all public school in singapore and have\n          seen over 100k announcements and forms sent.
